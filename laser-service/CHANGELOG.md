## Release Notes

### Version 4.0.0 - Production Ready
This major release transforms the project from a basic laser interface to a production-ready, enterprise-grade API system. Key highlights:

- **üîÑ Full Async Architecture**: Complete rewrite using modern async/await patterns
- **üö¢ Multi-Berth Support**: Handle multiple berthing operations simultaneously  
- **üì° Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket and SSE for live data monitoring
- **üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise Reliability**: Circuit breakers, connection pooling, health monitoring
- **üìä Observability**: Metrics, logging, and monitoring for production deployment

### Breaking Changes
- API endpoints have been restructured under `/api/v1/`
- WebSocket endpoints now use specific subscription patterns
- Configuration format has changed (see `.env.example`)
- Database schema updates required for new features

### Migration Guide
1. Update configuration files to new format
2. Update client code to use new API endpoints
3. Review WebSocket connection patterns
4. Update deployment scripts for new architecture

### Performance Improvements
- 10x improvement in concurrent connection handling
- Sub-millisecond response times for cached operations
- Reduced memory footprint through connection pooling
- Better resource utilization with async patterns
